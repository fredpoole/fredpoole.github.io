#### I am an Assistant Professor in the Master of Arts in Foreign Language Teaching program at Michigan State University. I received my Ph.D. in Instructional Technology and Learning Sciences in the College of Education at Utah State University in 2020. I also earned a Master of Second Language Teaching Degree in 2015. My research investigates the implementation of technology for improving and assessing second language literacy skills and the effect of well-designed games on second language learning, teaching, and classroom dynamics. My work has been published in Foreign Language Annals, System, and Language Learning & Technology. I have taught both English and Chinese as a Foreign language as well as graduate-level courses related to second language teaching methods, educational technology, and using games for learning.
